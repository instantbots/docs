# Optimizing tool calls

## Custom instructions

If your agent is having a hard time making tool calls reliably, your best bet is to [modify your instruction prompt](modifying-instruction-prompt.md) to tell your agent to execute specific tools when requests that match a pattern are made.

We're looking into ways to make tool calling more precise, like specific instructions per tool. If you feel like you need this feature ASAP, please reach out to [feedback@instant.bot](mailto:feedback@instant.bot).
